# Mission LunaTrix
Moon skating game — winner of PlayJam 7! Can't guarantee any good-practice code, but feel free to poke around and see what looks nice for you!

A full list of credits and dependencies can be found [here](https://rae.wtf/blog/mission-lunatrix-manual#credits).

If you wanna play this game, it's available for purchase [here](https://play.date/games/mission-lunatrix). Or, if you just LOVE command line tools, use `pdc` to build the `source/` folder, and enjoy! (Note that scoreboard functions won't work properly when building from source — for proper leaderboard support, please consider buying the game in Catalog!)
