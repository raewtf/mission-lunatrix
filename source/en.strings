They replenish oxygen.\nUFOs - These are rad! Hit 'em and score bonus points.\nFlags - Fun collectible! I wonder who's been here?\nRovers - These are bad! Hit one, and you get stunned."

Or at least, to another moon...\n\nIt's important to keep an eye on your oxygen levels.\nIf they reach zero, you'll be rather...stranded.\n\nYou can replenish oxygen by picking up O2 Canisters,\nor by escaping the current moon. Your O2 gauge will\nre-fill on every successful escape."
"howtoplay4" = "Ramping off of craters and performing tricks is key to\nyour escape! When you're sent into the air, use the crank\nin tandem with the d-pad to pull off different moves.\nAdvanced ones can score big points!\n\nWhen you reach a high enough score threshold, you'll\nstart flashing. This means you've got enough radical\npower charged up to escape the gravitational pull! Hit\nanother crater, and you'll be launched to the next moon."
"howtoplay5" = "When you successfully land from a jump, your combo\nmeter will increase. Hit more jumps to rack up\nthe multiplier and score MASSIVE points! There's no\nlimit, so go wild! Your final score is displayed at the end.\n\nIf you skate around for long enough without hitting\nanother crater, run into a rover, or get too overzealous\nwith your tricks, your meter will reset back to x1."
