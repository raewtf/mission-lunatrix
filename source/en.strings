They replenish oxygen.\nUFOs - These are rad! Hit 'em and score bonus points.\nFlags - Fun collectible! I wonder who's been here?\nRovers - These are bad! Hit one, and you get stunned."

Or at least, to another moon...\n\nIt's important to keep an eye on your oxygen levels.\nIf they reach zero, you'll be rather...stranded.\n\nYou can replenish oxygen by picking up O2 Canisters,\nor by escaping the current moon. Your O2 gauge will\nre-fill on every successful escape."

When you're sent into the air, use the crank\nin tandem with the d-pad to pull off different moves.\nAdvanced ones can score big points!\n\nWhen you reach a high enough score threshold, you'll\nstart flashing.
